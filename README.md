##### To setup fastlane

Follow the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Guide.md) to get started.
```
sudo gem install fastlane --verbose
```
Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:
```
xcode-select --install
```
If you experience slow launch times of fastlane, try running
```
gem cleanup
```
to clean up outdated gems.

System Requirements: `fastlane` requires Mac OS X or Linux with Ruby 2.0.0 or above.
